Submit your solution to B201Judge and pick the reee_tacc assignment.
If you got it correct, you can contact me on [whatsapp](https://wa.me/6281327522023), tell me who from your group that solved the problem then we will pick a date to do the "asistensi". The more you solve, the better the chance of your group getting the full score.

If the problems doesn't exist on reee_tacc assignment yet or the assignment is not open, you can submit your code to solang.dion@gmail.com. If it's not replied within 1 days, then please remind me through whatsapp.

If your group gave up solving the problem, you can still contact me and do "asistensi" but there is no chance for your group to get a full score.
