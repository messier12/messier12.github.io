# One two five? Where is the rest of them? Advanced

Gura forgot about the number 3 and 4, so now she counts like this.
1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 15 16 17 18 19 20 ... 28 29 50 51 52 55 ...

Your task is to convert Gura's counting to what it actually is.

The input is an integer less than 10000000000000000000 greater than 0 and will not contain any 3 or 4.

## Example
### Input 1
```
5
```
### Output 1
```
3
```
### Input 2
```
20
```
### Output 2
```
16
```
